Welcome to the Maemo Leste website! Maemo Leste continues the legacy of
`Maemo <http://maemo.org>`_. We aim to provide a free and open source
Maemo experience on mobile phones and tablets like the Nokia N900,
Motorola Droid 4, Motorola Bionic, Pinephone, Pinetab, Allwinner
tablets and more!

Feel free to join us on `irc.libera.chat
<ircs://irc.libera.chat/#maemo-leste>`_
**#maemo-leste** and also join our `mailing list
<https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/maemo-leste>`_
if you are interested.

We are also active on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/maemoleste>`_.

Maemo Leste is based on Devuan Beowulf (Debian Buster) and all the
supported devices ship with recent mainline Linux kernels.

The project is almost usable as a daily driver for your device. We are
currently in the development phase and we are actively searching for
developers. For some devices, we have development images available
- such as the `Nokia N900 <https://leste.maemo.org/Nokia_N900>`_,
`Motorola Droid 4 <https://leste.maemo.org/Motorola_Droid_4>`_, and
the `PinePhone <https://leste.maemo.org/PinePhone>`_. There is also
a 64bit `virtual machine <https://leste.maemo.org/Virtual_Machine>`_
you can use to try out Maemo Leste. For an impression, see some of our
`screenshots <{filename}/pages/screenshots.rst>`_.

So far we have set up repositories for our packages, which support
`amd64`, `armhf`, and `arm64` architectures. We have FOSS replacements
for all included and previously closed Maemo packages (and we have
no closed packages in use), further building on the Maemo community
efforts to replace all closed bits with open source software.

Installation guides are provided per device. For open
tasks and issues, please see our Github bugtracker:
